Edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf, and add the following line to the bottom: 

AddHandler cgi-script .rb

Add an .htaccess file containing the following text:

Options ExecCGI

The default location for CGI programs on an OS X apache installation is 

/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables 

Files placed in this directory can be accessed via the following URL:

http://localhost/cgi-bin/file-name

In order for Apache to be able to execute the CGI script, the permissions on the file must be set correctly. For example, open EditRocket and create a file called test.rb with the following contents. Save this file to the /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables directory.

#!/usr/bin/ruby
puts "Content-type: text/html"
puts ""
puts "<html>"
puts "<body>"
puts "Test Ruby Page."
puts "</body>"
puts "</html>"

Open a terminal window (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal). Execute the following command:

cd /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables

Then execute the following (if prompted, enter your password)

sudo chmod 755 test.rb

You now have a Ruby program, test.rb, saved with the correct permissions in the /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables directory.

Now, we need to restart the web server to make sure the changes take effect. To restart, do the following:

1. Go to System Preferences -> Sharing View

2. Uncheck the Web Sharing box. Then check the Web Sharing box again. This will start and stop the apache web server.

You can test this page by entering the following in your web browser:

http://localhost/cgi-bin/test.rb
